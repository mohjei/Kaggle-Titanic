This repository addresses predict survival on Titanic competition case hosted by Kaggle. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
In this challenge, the participant is expected to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. To this end, the current notebook covers a variety of analysis and predictive ensemble-based models.
